# Problem Statement

Although Airbnb provides hosts with general guidance, there are no easy to access methods to determine the best price to rent out a space. There is third-party software available, but for a hefty price. One method could be to find a few listings that are similar to the place that will be up for rent, average the listed prices and set our price to this calculated average price. However, with the market being so dynamic, we would probably be looking to update the price regularly and this method can become tedious. Moreover, this may not be very accurate, as we are not taking into account other important factors that may give us a comparative advantage over other listings around us. This could be property characteristics such as number of rooms, type of room,location ,neighbourhood of the property and extra services on offer.

The aim of this project is to propose a data-driven solution, by using machine learning to predict rental price.
